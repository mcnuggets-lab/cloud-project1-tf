This is my about page. :wave:

I am a data scientist learning MLOps. This website is a part of the learning process.

With a heavy math background, I came to the world of DS/ML/AI after a fun journey. Funny things that I've done include (but are not limited to):
<br/><br/>
- got a PhD in math that is *essentially useless* for my remaining life,<br/><br/>
- ... except I wrote a fiction book (in Chinese) about that journey, which was published.<br/><br/>
- self-taught many programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Scala, Python, Rust, and more through various online courses and projects, and understand different paradigms of programming languages, **purely for fun**.<br/><br/>
- self-taught data structures, algorithms and more CS concepts, which led me to highly abstract concepts like automata, computability, Turing machines, Godel, etc. **These surprisingly relate back to the mathematical logic classes I took years before.**<br/><br/>
- I got my first job (outside of academia) because my employer back then *mixed up Java and JavaScript*, and thought that I, knowing Java, would be a good fit for their web projects.<br/><br/>
- ... this was how I learned JavaScript, various web frameworks, and frontend and backend concepts (such as MVC, Rest API, etc.)<br/><br/>
- I enrolled in a big data master program without knowing how to read a CSV file using Python and ended up being the top student of my year in that program,<br/><br/>
- ... which landed me data science jobs, which are **fun**.<br/><br/>
- got a Professional Scrum Master I certificate because both the course and the exam is company-sponsored.<br/><br/>
- Next up: learn MLOps and Cloud (mainly AWS).

I strongly believe that **if I don't stop learning, the fun will continue**.
