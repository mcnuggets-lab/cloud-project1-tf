This repo is based on https://github.com/noahgift/dukehugofeb1, with some non-trivial modifications and added components to make it work better. Instead of manually deploying each component in AWS, this project uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as IaC. The aim is for me to learn MLOps in AWS environment only, so the website built is very raw.
